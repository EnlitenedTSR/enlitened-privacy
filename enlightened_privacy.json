If data is transferred outside the EEA, then           adequate safe guards will be in place and details will be included in section below on sharing your data.</p>        <h2>Sharing your data</h2>        <p>We will not routinely be sharing any of the personal data we process for the Enlitened website, except in           the following circumstances:</p>       <ul>           <li>               <strong>Third-party data processors</strong>               <p>We may appoint a third-party data processor to carry out specific processing activities. In all uses                   of data processors, we will ensure contracts are in place containing all the clauses required by                   data protection law. To date, our data processors in place are:</p>               <ul>                   <li>AWS [Amazon Web Services]                       <ul>                           <li>Data storage</li>                           <li>Based in the EEA</li>                       </ul>                   </li>                   <li>MailGun                       <ul>                           <li>Email service provider</li>                           <li>Based in the EEA</li>                       </ul>                   </li>                   <li>Google Universal Analytics                       <ul>                           <li>Website analytics</li>                           <li>Data can be transferred to the US and is safeguarded by Privacy Shield rules</li>                       </ul>                   </li>                   <li>Professional advisors                       <ul>                           <li>including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, legal,                               insurance and accounting services</li>                           <li>Based in the EEA</li>                       </ul>                   </li>               </ul>           </li>           <li>               <strong>Institution</strong>               <p>The institution may have access to reports showing which staff members have logged in to the                   Enlitened report website, the times this has happened and what reports have been viewed. This will                   be done securely via the Enlitened website. It will enable your institution to monitor the use of                   the Enlitened reports and see how effective they are.</p>           </li>           <li>               <strong>Regulators or other authorities</strong>               <p>Under some circumstances official regulators or other authorities may require, by law, information                   about our data processing activities. This will rarely require us to share personal data and would                   only ever share the minimum personal data that we are legally obliged to do so.</p>           </li>       </ul>        <p>Your personal data will not be shared with any third parties outside of The Student Room Group Ltd or those           listed above.</p>        <h2>5. Data security</h2>        <p>We have put in place appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent your personal           data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.</p>       <p>In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third           parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and           they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>       <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any           applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>        <h2>6. Data retention</h2>        <p>Your personal data will be kept in the Enlitened system throughout the time your institution holds an active           contract with The Student Room Group Ltd and for up to 12 months after the contract ends.</p>       <p>This will include all account details, usage logs and analytics logs containing personal data.</p>       <p>Any aggregated reports based on personal data are no longer classed as personal data, and so will be kept           indefinitely.</p>       <p>There are two exceptions to this:</p>       <ol>           <li>You request the deletion of your personal data in the Enlitened system</li>           <li>There is another legal basis for keeping any of the data for longer, for example, the establishment or               defence of a legal claim</li>       </ol>        <h2>7. Children&rsquo;s Information</h2>        <p>The Enlitened reporting website is not intended to be used by people below the age of 18. In the UK a child           is defined as being over the age of 13 for data protection laws.</p>       <p>We therefore do not knowingly process the personal data of any children. In addition, this privacy notice           and other privacy information on the website has been reviewed to ensure it is understandable by people           aged 18 or above.</p>        <h2>8. Your legal rights</h2>       <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under UK law in relation to your personal data. You will not           usually have to pay a fee to exercise these rights and we will usually respond within 30 days unless the           request is particularly complex. We may also require more information from you to confirm your identity and           ensure the security of personal data, if you exercise these rights.</p>       <ul>           <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where we rely on your explicit consent as the legal basis for processing your               data.
